              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Triund is a popular trekking destination located in the
                Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh. It is an
                easy trek that can be completed in 1 night and 2 days, making it
                a perfect weekend getaway for adventure enthusiasts. The trek
                starts from McLeod Ganj, a popular tourist destination and home
                to the Dalai Lama. The trail is well-marked and passes through
                lush green forests of oak, rhododendron, and deodar trees, with
                stunning views of the Kangra valley.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first half of the trek is relatively easy, with gradual
                inclines and a few steep stretches. The second half, however, is
                a bit challenging, with steeper inclines and rocky terrain. It
                takes about 4-5 hours to reach Triund from McLeodGanj, depending
                on your fitness level. Once you reach Triund, you are greeted
                with stunning panoramic views of the surrounding mountains,
                including the snow-capped Dhauladhar range. The campsite at
                Triund is a popular spot for overnight stays, and there are
                several tents and guesthouses available for rent. You can also
                set up your own tent and camp under the stars.
