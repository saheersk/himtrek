          <h3>Best Time to Visit?</h3>
          <p>
            The best time to visit Triund trek is from March to June and August
            to December. During these months, the weather is pleasant, and the
            skies are clear, making it an ideal time for trekking and enjoying
            the breathtaking views of the Dhauladhar range. It's recommended to
            avoid the monsoon season from July to August as the trail can become
            slippery and dangerous due to heavy rainfall.

          <h3>How Difficult is the Triund Trek?</h3>
          <p>
            The Triund trek is considered to be an easy trek. The total distance
            of the trek is around 9 kilometres (5.6 miles), and it takes around
            4-6 hours to complete the trek depending on your fitness level and
            the weather conditions. The trail is well-marked and passes through
            lush green forests of oak, rhododendron, and deodar trees, with
            stunning views of the Kangra valley. However, the last stretch of
            the trek can be a bit steep and strenuous. With a basic level of
            fitness, the trek can be completed easily.
